# sorting-algorith-visualizer
its a graphical user interface application to uderstand the sorting algorithm
SortingVisualizer

Mostly all of us know various Sorting Algorithms.Sometimes we may find difficulty in understanding how the comparisions and swappings are done in various Sorting Algorithms. So to understand these even better I have developed a desktop application using Python through which you can easily visualize the internal implementations of these Algorithms with Graphics and Animations , even you can change the speed of animation for your better understanding

Sorting Algorithms

    Bubble Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Selection Sort
    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort

Features

    You can select the length of arr using the slider
    You can set Minimum and Maximum Value to randomly generate array in that range
    You can select the Algorithm from dropdown list to select the Sorting Algorithm
    You can set the speed of animation for better understanding using the slider the values in the slider are same as youtube videos speed.
    By Clicking on the Generate Button You will see different random array in the form of bars. Each bar represents one array element
    By Clicking on start Button you will see the visualization of the selected Algorithm with different colors and moving animations

Requirements

    Python 3
    PyQt5
    PyQt5-tools

The above two listed are packages which can be installed via pip

Type these commands in cmd prompt to install it

pip install PyQt5 pip install PyQt5-tools

I have also provided the executable of this project incase if you just want to see how it works without installing anything even python is also not required.

download the rar file named Sorting Visualizer(Executable).rar and extract it after that open the extracted folder and double click on the Visualizer.exe file to run the program
